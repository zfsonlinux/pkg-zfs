Subject: Remove the upstream dracut component.

The dracut/ component broke deb systems when it first added to the
upstream ZoL repository, had a near-zero download count when it was
fixed, seems to be unmaintained, and is incompatible with the
dracut-005 package that is currently published in Debian and Ubuntu.

-How to setup a zfs root filesystem using dracut
------------------------------------------------
-
-1) Install the zfs-dracut package.  This package adds a zfs dracut module
-to the /usr/share/dracut/modules.d/ directory which allows dracut to
-create an initramfs which is zfs aware.
-
-2) Set the bootfs property for the bootable dataset in the pool.  Then set
-the dataset mountpoint property to '/'.
-
-    $ zpool set bootfs=pool/dataset pool
-    $ zfs set mountpoint=/ pool/dataset
-
-Alternately, legacy mountpoints can be used by setting the 'root=' option
-on the kernel line of your grub.conf/menu.lst configuration file.  Then
-set the dataset mountpoint property to 'legacy'.
-
-    $ grub.conf/menu.lst: kernel ... root=ZFS=pool/dataset
-    $ zfs set mountpoint=legacy pool/dataset
-
-3) To set zfs module options put them in /etc/modprobe.d/zfs.conf file.
-The complete list of zfs module options is available by running the
-_modinfo zfs_ command.  Commonly set options include: zfs_arc_min,
-zfs_arc_max, zfs_prefetch_disable, and zfs_vdev_max_pending.
-
-4) Finally, create your new initramfs by running dracut.
-
-    $ dracut --force /path/to/initramfs kernel_version
-
-Kernel Command Line
--------------------
-
-The initramfs' behavior is influenced by the following kernel command line
-parameters passed in from the boot loader:
-
-* `root=...`: If not set, importable pools are searched for a bootfs
-attribute.  If an explicitly set root is desired, you may use
-`root=ZFS:pool/dataset`
-
-* `zfs_force=0`: If set to 1, the initramfs will run `zpool import -f` when
-attempting to import pools if the required pool isn't automatically imported
-by the zfs module.  This can save you a trip to a bootcd if hostid has
-changed, but is dangerous and can lead to zpool corruption, particularly in
-cases where storage is on a shared fabric such as iSCSI where multiple hosts
-can access storage devices concurrently.  _Please understand the implications
-of force-importing a pool before enabling this option!_
-
-* `spl_hostid`: By default, the hostid used by the SPL module is read from
-/etc/hostid inside the initramfs.  This file is placed there from the host
-system when the initramfs is built which effectively ties the ramdisk to the
-host which builds it.  If a different hostid is desired, one may be set in
-this attribute and will override any file present in the ramdisk.  The
-format should be hex exactly as found in the `/etc/hostid` file, IE
-`spl_hostid=0x00bab10c`.
-
-Note that changing the hostid between boots will most likely lead to an
-un-importable pool since the last importing hostid won't match.  In order
-to recover from this, you may use the `zfs_force` option or boot from a
-different filesystem and `zpool import -f` then `zpool export` the pool
-before rebooting with the new hostid.
-
-How it Works
-============
-
-The Dracut module consists of the following files (less Makefile's):
-
-* `module-setup.sh`: Script run by the initramfs builder to create the
-ramdisk.  Contains instructions on which files are required by the modules
-and z* programs.  Also triggers inclusion of `/etc/hostid` and the zpool
-cache.  This file is not included in the initramfs.
-
-* `90-zfs.rules`: udev rules which trigger loading of the ZFS modules at boot.
-
-* `parse-zfs.sh`: Run early in the initramfs boot process to parse kernel
-command line and determine if ZFS is the active root filesystem.
-
-* `mount-zfs.sh`: Run later in initramfs boot process after udev has settled
-to mount the root dataset.
-
-`module-setup.sh`
----------------
-
-This file is run by the Dracut script within the live system, not at boot
-time.  It's not included in the final initramfs.  Functions in this script
-describe which files are needed by ZFS at boot time.
-
-Currently all the various z* and spl modules are included, a dependency is
-asserted on udev-rules, and the various zfs, zpool, etc. helpers are included.
-Dracut provides library functions which automatically gather the shared libs
-necessary to run each of these binaries, so statically built binaries are
-not required.
-
-The zpool and zvol udev rules files are copied from where they are
-installed by the ZFS build.  __PACKAGERS TAKE NOTE__: If you move
-`/etc/udev/rules/60-z*.rules`, you'll need to update this file to match.
-
-Currently this file also includes `/etc/hostid` and `/etc/zfs/zpool.cache`
-which means the generated ramdisk is specific to the host system which built
-it.  If a generic initramfs is required, it may be preferable to omit these
-files and specify the `spl_hostid` from the boot loader instead.
-
-`parse-zfs.sh`
-------------
-
-Run during the cmdline phase of the initramfs boot process, this script
-performs some basic sanity checks on kernel command line parameters to
-determine if booting from ZFS is likely to be what is desired.  Dracut
-requires this script to adjust the `root` variable if required and to set
-`rootok=1` if a mountable root filesystem is available.  Unfortunately this
-script must run before udev is settled and kernel modules are known to be
-loaded, so accessing the zpool and zfs commands is unsafe.
-
-If the root=ZFS... parameter is set on the command line, then it's at least
-certain that ZFS is what is desired, though this script is unable to
-determine if ZFS is in fact available.  This script will alter the `root`
-parameter to replace several historical forms of specifying the pool and
-dataset name with the canonical form of `zfs:pool/dataset`.
-
-If no root= parameter is set, the best this script can do is guess that
-ZFS is desired.  At present, no other known filesystems will work with no
-root= parameter, though this might possibly interfere with using the
-compiled-in default root in the kernel image.  It's considered unlikely
-that would ever be the case when an initramfs is in use, so this script
-sets `root=zfs:AUTO` and hopes for the best.
-
-Once the root=... (or lack thereof) parameter is parsed, a dummy symlink
-is created from `/dev/root` -> `/dev/null` to satisfy parts of the Dracut
-process which check for presence of a single root device node.
-
-Finally, an initqueue/finished hook is registered which causes the initqueue
-phase of Dracut to wait for `/dev/zfs` to become available before attempting
-to mount anything.
-
-`mount-zfs.sh`
-------------
-
-This script is run after udev has settled and all tasks in the initqueue
-have succeeded.  This ensures that `/dev/zfs` is available and that the
-various ZFS modules are successfully loaded.  As it is now safe to call
-zpool and friends, we can proceed to find the bootfs attribute if necessary.
-
-If the root parameter was explicitly set on the command line, no parsing is
-necessary.  The list of imported pools is checked to see if the desired pool
-is already imported.  If it's not, and attempt is made to import the pool
-explicitly, though no force is attempted.  Finally the specified dataset
-is mounted on `$NEWROOT`, first using the `-o zfsutil` option to handle
-non-legacy mounts, then if that fails, without zfsutil to handle legacy
-mount points.
-
-If no root parameter was specified, this script attempts to find a pool with
-its bootfs attribute set.  First, already-imported pools are scanned and if
-an appropriate pool is found, no additional pools are imported.  If no pool
-with bootfs is found, any additional pools in the system are imported with
-`zpool import -N -a`, and the scan for bootfs is tried again.  If no bootfs
-is found with all pools imported, all pools are re-exported, and boot fails.
-Assuming a bootfs is found, an attempt is made to mount it to `$NEWROOT`,
-first with, then without the zfsutil option as above.
-
-Ordinarily pools are imported _without_ the force option which may cause
-boot to fail if the hostid has changed or a pool has been physically moved
-between servers.  The `zfs_force` kernel parameter is provided which when
-set to `1` causes `zpool import` to be run with the `-f` flag.  Forcing pool
-import can lead to serious data corruption and loss of pools, so this option
-should be used with extreme caution.  Note that even with this flag set, if
-the required zpool was auto-imported by the kernel module, no additional
-`zpool import` commands are run, so nothing is forced.
