Architecture: linux-any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Replaces: libnvpair0
Description: Solaris name-value library for Linux
 This library provides routines for packing and unpacking nv pairs for
 transporting data across process boundaries, transporting between
 kernel and userland, and possibly saving onto disk files.

Package: libuutil1
Section: libs
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Replaces: libuutil0
Description: Solaris userland utility library for Linux
 This library provides a variety of glue functions for ZFS on Linux:

   minimal modification.
 * libavl: The Adelson-Velskii Landis balanced binary tree manipulation library.
 * libefi: The Extensible Firmware Interface library for GUID disk partitioning.
 * libshare: NFS and SMB service integration for ZFS.
